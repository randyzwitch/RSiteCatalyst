RSiteCatalyst is an R package for accessing the Adobe Analytics API. The focus of this package are analysts looking for a convenient, programmatic way for accessing their website data using the power of R.

---

## **Getting Started**
### Installation
RSiteCatalyst can be installed from CRAN as follows:
```r
install.packages("RSiteCatalyst", type = "source")
```

After installing RSiteCatalyst, you need to have <u>Web Services Access</u> enabled in the `User Management -> Users -> Access` menu in the Adobe Analytics Admin panel:

![](./images/web-services-access.png)

Additionally, you will either need to obtain your Web Services Credentials or register an OAuth2 application, which will be discussed in detail in the Authentication section.

---

### Authentication

Regardless of whether you choose the 'legacy' method for authentication or the newer OAuth2 method, the API will return the same data. Which method you choose depends on your company security requirements, familiarity with OAuth2 or your application-specific details.

#### Legacy (WSSE) [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/authentication-1/using-web-service-credentials-2) {.toc-ignore}

The 'legacy' method of authenticating with the Adobe Analytics API requires knowing your <u>User Name</u> and <u>Shared Secret</u>, which can be obtained from the same `User Management -> Users -> Access` menu in the Admin panel where Web Services Access is granted.

With the <u>User Name</u> and <u>Shared Secret</u> values, you can start the authentication process in RSiteCatalyst through the `SCAuth()` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(RSiteCatalyst)
SCAuth("username:company", "cd1d234dee56e8202da6f7d3213eb1ef")
```
```
## [1] "Credentials Saved in RSiteCatalyst Namespace."
```

Note that when the `SCAuth()` function is submitted, RSiteCatalyst doesn't actually validate whether the credentials are correct (i.e. verify that the API will return an answer), other than to validate the the `key` and `secret` values have the proper format.

When submitting an API request, should your credentials not be accepted by the Adobe Analytics API, you will see the following message (or similar):
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(RSiteCatalyst)
SCAuth("username:company", "cd1d234dee56e8202da6f7d3213eb1ef")
```
```
## [1] "Credentials Saved in RSiteCatalyst Namespace."
```
```{r, eval = FALSE}
GetReportSuites()
```
```
## Error in ApiRequest(func.name = "Company.GetReportSuites") : 
##  ERROR: Bad Request  -  Unable to validate authentication.
```

#### OAuth2 [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/authentication-1/auth-overview-1#concept_4646CEC9CE5E4698A936D84B90A2CD0C) {.toc-ignore}

TBD

--- 

### Tips and Tricks

#### 1. Saving credentials to .Renviron {.toc-ignore}

While not secure _per se_, to avoid putting your User Name and Shared Secret in the clear inside of an R script, you can place your credentials in the [.Renviron](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/base/html/Startup.html) environment file. This file is loaded each time R is loaded, setting global environment variables.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
USER="username:company"
SECRET="cd1d234dee56e8202da6f7d3213eb1ef"
```

Again, this is not truly 'secure', it is just security-through-obscurity. If you use this method, your `SCAuth()` call now becomes the following:

```{r, cache=FALSE}
library(RSiteCatalyst)
SCAuth(Sys.getenv("USER"), Sys.getenv("SECRET"))
```

Not enough to stop a truly determined hacker, but enough so that credentials aren't checked into version control or copy-pasted/shared across
users.

#### 2. Running GetReportSuites() at the beginning of a session {.toc-ignore}

One of the best use cases of RSiteCatalyst is accessing large amounts of data, whether that means running reports for a long time period or for many report suites at one time.

By running `GetReportSuites()` at the beginning of a session, not only do you get a quick refresher of the report suites contained in your Adobe Analytics, but you have a vector that you can pass to other RSiteCatalyst functions:

```{r, cache=cacheflag}
rs <- GetReportSuites()
rs
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Pass the list of report suite ids, not the whole data frame
props <- GetProps(rs$rsid)
```

---

## **Contributing**

RSiteCatalyst is a community-driven, open-source effort, not an official package from Adobe. As such, bug fixes and improvements rely on a vibrant community of users and developers contributing their free time and resources.

### Issues {.toc-ignore}

If you encounter a bug when using RSiteCatalyst, please use the [Issues](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues) section of the [RSiteCatalyst GitHub repository](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/) to report your issue. When reporting an issue, please include as much information as possible, preferably a reproducible code example. The following information is also valuable for troubleshooting:

    * R version
    * Operating System and Version
    * RSiteCatalyst version (please upgrade to newest version on CRAN before reporting a bug)
    * Environment (RStudio, R command line, cron, etc.)

While [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) requires a valid email address for package submission, personalized help via the maintainer email address is not feasible and will not receive a response.

### Feature Requests {.toc-ignore}

While RSiteCatalyst has near feature parity with the Adobe Analytics API Explorer on an _analytics/data retrieval_ basis, this package intentionally does not provide lower-level features such as creating or deleting report suites, uploading SAINT classifications or other 'development' type features. While these types of features _may_ be accepted into the package with a pull request of sufficient breadth and quality, they will not be a focus of the core developers.

If there is analytics functionality desired that is currently available in the Adobe Analytics API but not in RSiteCatalyst, please create an [issue](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/issues) on the [RSiteCatalyst GitHub repository](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/), linking to the appropriate section of the Adobe Analytics API documentation. An explanation of your business goals and expected business value will go a long way towards convincing a volunteer to add the functionality.

### Submiting A Pull Request {.toc-ignore}

Of course, if you'd like to have a feature added AND submit a pull request to [RSiteCatalyst GitHub repository](https://github.com/randyzwitch/RSiteCatalyst/), the likelihood of seeing the feature added increases dramatically!

RSiteCatalyst is provided under the [MIT License](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license). Before contributing, please be sure you agree with the terms of the MIT license. All contributions merged into RSiteCatalyst become part of the MIT-licensed package whole; contributions with different license terms desired will not be accepted.

## **Analytics Functions** [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/get-started)

The functions in this section represent the types of information a user can retrieve from the Adobe Analytics UI. However, in most cases, the API via RSiteCatalyst can retrieve more data than is displayed in the web interface.

Note that because of the extensive number of keyword arguments for each function, it's not feasible to show examples of all functionality. Please see the [Examples](/#examples) section above or the detailed documentation within the RSiteCatalyst R manual.

#### BuildClassificationValueSegment [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>]()

Used for creating inline segments for use in Queue* functions. This is a convenience function to create the proper formatting for the required JSON object, it does not call the API itself.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
vistor_segment <- BuildClassificationValueSegment(element,
                                                  search.keywords,
                                                  classification,
                                                  search.type)
```

#### BuildRealTimeReportStructure

Selects the metrics and elements (dimensions) on which you want Real-Time reports enabled. This is a convenience function to create the proper formatting for the required JSON object, it does not call the API itself.

Use the returned list from this function as argument(s) in SaveRealTimeSettings.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
report.test1 <- BuildRealTimeReportStructure(report.name="test123",
               metric="instances",
               elements = c("prop2", "searchenginekeyword", "geocountry"))

report.test2 <- BuildRealTimeReportStructure(report.name="test456",
               metric="instances",
               elements = c("prop2", "searchenginekeyword", "geocountry"),
               min.granularity = "5")

report.test3 <- BuildRealTimeReportStructure(report.name="test789",
               metric="instances",
               elements = c("prop2", "searchenginekeyword", "geocountry"),
               min.granularity = "5",
               ui.report=FALSE)
```

#### GetReport [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>]()

```{r, cache=cacheflag}
#TBD
```

#### GetReportsByIds [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>]()

```{r, cache=cacheflag}
#TBD
```

#### QueueDataWarehouse [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

QueueDatawarehouse is a method that can both schedule Data Warehouse reports (like in the Adobe Analytics interface), as well as return reports back in the R interface as calculated by Data Warehouse (developmental). For the most part, users should pass the `enqueueOnly=TRUE` parameters with the `ftp` parameter to send reports to the FTP.

API:
```{r, cache=cacheflag}
# Because report sent to FTP, returns the report.id value
QueueDataWarehouse("zwitchdev",
                    "2016-11-01",
                    "2016-11-07",
                    c("visits", "pageviews"),
                    c("page"),
                    enqueueOnly=TRUE,
                    ftp = list(host = Sys.getenv("FTP", ""),
                              port = "21",
                              directory = "/DWtest/",
                              username = Sys.getenv("FTPUSER", ""),
                              password = Sys.getenv("FTPPW", ""),
                              filename = "myreport.csv")
  )
```

#### QueueFallout [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

This method generates the underlying data for a Fallout/Pathing report within Adobe Analytics. The API method supports both visits and pageviews as metrics.

Adobe Analytics Interface:
![](./images/queuefallout.png)

API: 
```{r, cache=cacheflag}
QueueFallout("zwitchdev",
                   "2016-08-01",
                   "2016-12-31",
                   metric="visits",
                   element="page",
                   c("http://randyzwitch.com/r-amazon-ec2", "http://randyzwitch.com/julia-import-data"))
```

#### QueueOvertime [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

This method is analogous to the "Key Metrics" report within Adobe Analytics. Note that the API method does not return the total row, just the metrics by the time breakdown.

Adobe Analytics Interface:
![](./images/queueovertime.png)

API:
```{r, cache=cacheflag}
QueueOvertime("zwitchdev", "2016-09-07", "2016-09-13", "visits", date.granularity = "week")
```

#### QueuePathing [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

QueuePathing is the API method that calculates the underlying data for NextPage, Fallout and other path-related reports within Adobe Analytics.

Adobe Analytics Interface:
![](./images/queuepathing.png)

API:
```{r, cache=cacheflag}
pathpattern <- c("::anything::", "::anything::")
QueuePathing("zwitchdev",
            "2016-09-19",
            "2016-09-19",
            metric="pageviews",
            element="page",
            pathpattern,
            top = 5)
```

#### QueueRanked [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

QueueRanked represents the data from a ranked report within Adobe Analytics, where one or more elements is specified with no dateGranularity. Note that the API method does not return the total row, just the metrics by the breakdown(s) specified.

Adobe Analytics Interface:
![](./images/queueranked.png)

```{r, cache=cacheflag}
QueueRanked("zwitchdev", "2016-10-01", "2016-10-31", "pageviews", "page", top = 10)
```

#### QueueSummary [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

QueueSummary does not map to an interface report per se; rather, QueueSummary provides the total calculation row for many reports within Adobe Analytics. It is this method that will provide 'unique` calculations such as visitors, which would be incorrectly summed across an element such as page views.

```{r, cache=cacheflag}
QueueSummary(rs$rsid, "2016-09-01", "visits")
```

#### QueueTrended [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-reporting-1-4/r-queue)

QueueTrended is similar to a QueueOvertime report, except instead of just having a metric by time granularity, you can specify an element to trend. One notable feature for the API method is that it removes the restriction of five element values to be trended over time (i.e. Top 5 pages over time)

Adobe Analytics Interface:
![](./images/queuetrended.png)

API:
```{r, cache=cacheflag}
QueueTrended("zwitchdev", "2016-09-07", "2016-09-13", "visits", "page", selected = c("http://randyzwitch.com"))
```

#### SaveRealTimeSettings [<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-link"</span>](https://marketing.adobe.com/developer/documentation/analytics-administration-1-4/r-saverealtimesettings)

Selects the metrics and elements (dimensions) on which you want real time reports enabled.
Realtime configuration changes take 15 minutes to be reflected in reports.

WARNING: This function allows you to change the settings in your Adobe Analytics UI for all users, so be sure this is what you want to do. Additionally, submitting this function with only one report will mean other reports are deleted, you're NOT just changing a single report.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SaveRealTimeSettings(reportsuite.ids = "", report1 = list(),
  report2 = list(), report3 = list())
```

#### SCAuth

```{r, eval=FALSE}
SCAuth("username:company", "cd1d234dee56e8202da6f7d3213eb1ef")
```

#### SubmitJsonQueueReport

A function for advanced users, for the case where a user feels that submitting a JSON request to the Report.Queue API endpoint would be easier than using one of the pre-defined functions from RSiteCatalyst.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
report <- SubmitJsonQueueReport("valid JSON string")
```
